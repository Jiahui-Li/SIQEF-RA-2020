# Time Series Analysis

Author: DING Xiangyu

In this section I applied time series analysis techinques in two cases: USA nominal GDP, and China's manufacture value add. 

ARIMA model, Seasonality, and Spectral Analysis were used, and data were available from Wind Financial Terminal provided by PHBS.

The functions and methods can be apply to many other interesting cases in Economics and Business analysis.

Cases on clustering and classification will be updated soon.

Parts of the videos are worth watching. But beware: she is often very informal and not rigorous in defining things, so parts are difficult to understand because she goes too fast and casually.
