We collect some hard cases in this file, of which the majority is to conduct complex and advanced multiple ML algorithms in some real-world data and try to visualize results and give specific applications or backtests. It will cost you a lot of time to look through every details.  

Besides, `Fddc2018` and `Audience expansion` are two expert-level cases, provided to show how engineers using machine learning in the real industry, which you may try to finish on your own.
