# Machine-Learning-Case

## AAAI
This project is a cluster analysis of data, which is based on the cluster analysis of all the papers received by AAAI in 2014 `[UCI] AAAI-14 Accepted Papers-Papers`. The characteristics of this data set are shown in the following table:

|Feature  | Description|
| :------------: |:---------------:|
|title  | paper title  |
|authors  | paper author  |
|groups  | high-level keywords selected by the author  |
|keywords  | keywords generated by author |
|topics  | Low-level keywords selected by the author  |
|abstracts  | paper abstract  |


First, we perform feature conversion, expand the data set according to the advanced keywords selected by the author, and then use k-means, Gaussian mixture model, Bayesian Gaussian mixture model to cluster the data set. Also, we visually analyze the clustering results using word cloud. In the end, the Bayesian Gaussian mixture model has the best clustering effect. When the data is clustered into 3 clusters, the Silouette coefficient is the largest.
